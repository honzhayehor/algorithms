# Algorithms

This repository is my attempt to implement basic algorithms (sorting, searching, etc).

At first, I plan to divide algorithms into 3 sections*:
1. Sorting
2. Searching
3. Graph

That can provide a good structure to my library, but I can change my mind.

\* - shoutout to ForrestKnight (https://www.youtube.com/@fknight) as he inspired me to use that algorithm division.
